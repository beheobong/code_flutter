
To double the speed of the video, you can use:

>> ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=0.5*PTS" output.mkv
The filter works by changing the presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video frame. For example, if there are two succesive frames shown at timestamps 1 and 2, and you want to speed up the video, those timestamps need to become 0.5 and 1, respectively. Thus, we have to multiply them by 0.5.

Note that this method will drop frames to achieve the desired speed. You can avoid dropped frames by specifying a higher output frame rate than the input. For example, to go from an input of 4 FPS to one that is sped up to 4x that (16 FPS):

ffmpeg -i input.mkv -r 16 -filter:v "setpts=0.25*PTS" output.mkv
To slow down your video, you have to use a multiplier greater than 1:

>>> ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter:v "setpts=2.0*PTS" output.mkv

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf “setpts=(1/<speed>)*PTS” output.mp4

Change fps and remove audio in video:

ffmpeg -i slowmo120.mp4 -r 120 -vf "setpts=(1/4)*PTS" -an realtime120.mp4
