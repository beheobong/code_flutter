I,
ffmpeg -i input1.mp3 -i input2.mp3 -i input3.mp3 -filter_complex concat=n=3:v=0:a=1 -f MOV -vn -y input.m4a

Meanings of : " -filter_complex concat=n=3:v=0:a=1" : 
concat means use the media concatenate (joining) function.
n means confirm total count of input files.
v means has video? use 0 = no video, 1 = contains video.
a means has audio? use 0 = no audio, 1 = contain audio.
-f means force set file format (to see all supported formats, use ffmpeg -formats)
-vn means disable video (and also -an would disable audio if not wanted)
-y means overwrite output files (if the output file already exists).

II,
FFmpeg has three concat methods.

+ concat protocol
ffmpeg -i 'concat:input1|input2' -codec copy output

+ concat video filter
ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv \
  -filter_complex '[0:0] [0:1] [1:0] [1:1] [2:0] [2:1] concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 [v] [a]' \
  -map '[v]' -map '[a]' output.mkv

+ concat demuxer
$ cat mylist.txt
file '/path/to/file1'
file '/path/to/file2'
file '/path/to/file3'

$ ffmpeg -f concat -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4

(Note: Write file with UTF-8 format)

>> Which one to use
concat protocol: use with formats that support file level concatenation (MPEG-1, MPEG-2 PS, DV).
concat filter: use if you need to re-encode such as when applying filters.
concat demuxer: use when you want to avoid a re-encode and your format does not support file level concatenation.
If in doubt try the concat demuxer.
